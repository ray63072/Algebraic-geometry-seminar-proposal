We collect ideas for running AG seminars in TW

There are few categories. The first two are for graduate students, postdoc, and (A)P's.


1. Research oriented
Participants have to provoke ideas and ask questions, about presentation or 
providing new problems.

People give talks on different research topics that he/she is interested in 
or from invited (internal) speakers. The key part is to lay down precise problems 
that participant can try to think about directly. Several talks is allowed if necessary.

Colaboration: This is only for people who want to work together. 

2. Journal club: learning
Participant propose different advanced topics for running seminars. 
Proposal should contain the main theme, references, and the stream of talks, 
preferably within one research direction each time.

Learning seminar: This is for undergraduate or master students.
3. Diploma seminar: Senior people can try to find topics suitable for 
undergraduate or master project. Also welcome proposals from students. 
One way to find more problems is through 1 and 2. Extensive reading through 
online source is also good.
